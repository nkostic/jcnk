JCNK debut at [BEAMS - Duelling axis event](https://blog.beams.ca/2019/10/duelling-axes.html)

Pleasant evening at frog collective space (10144 89 Street) from 7pm to midnight.
We watched fellow BEAMERS pair up to bend, twist, morph, and experiment with sound.  

BEAMERS brought instruments of their choosing to perform alongside each other and an Oscilloscope for a night of experimentation, good people, and interesting sound performances.

Artists linup:

- Wayne DeFehr and Trevor DePagie
- Reinhard von Berg and Samson

- Fecal point VS Caves to Hades

This was our first gig in front ouf the crowd so we prepared bunch of samples using Behringer Neutron, Osci studio, Blender, Ableton. The setup was including Neuton (Javier), Ableton, 8x8 controller and my wife's laptop (Nenad).
